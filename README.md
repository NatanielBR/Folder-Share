#Folder Share

Folder sharing is a program made in Kotlin and Ktor to share the running folder via an http URL. The default url is 0.0.0.0:8080 and there's no way to change it (I'll implement it later).

#How to use

* Download the latest binaries

* * For Windows systems, go to the Versions tab.

* * For other systems, I haven't compiled for another operating system besides my system. Then you will have to compile the source code using `./gradlew installDist`.
    
* Do double click in the executable file.
